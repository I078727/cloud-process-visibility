## Download and Installation
Describe, in detail, how the project should be downloaded and installed.  

The developer can assume that the user will know how to clone or download a project.  If a binary or installer is included, this should be described (and links used to the file).  

The installation instructions should be bootstrap instructions, in other words, they should start from a clean slate and complete when the software is ready for use.  Please be as specific as possible, and the team is encouraged to use images and other documentation to make this section complete.  Do not take shortcuts that assume the user will be in the correct directory or have specific installation tools available (except where those were listed specifically in the requirements section.)

Note:  This section is the most likely to fail the review cycle.  Please review carefully.
